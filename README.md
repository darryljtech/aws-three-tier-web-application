# Three-Tier Web Application Architecture on AWS

## Overview

This repository provides code to deploy a three-tier web application architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The three-tier architecture is a popular, scalable, and flexible pattern for web applications. It separates the application into three logical layers: Presentation, Application Logic, and Data Storage, each running on separate servers. This separation enhances security, scalability, and manageability.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Presentation Layer (Web Tier)

- **AWS Services**: Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- **Description**: This layer consists of web servers and load balancers that directly interact with the end-users. It serves the user interface and static content of the web application. ELB distributes incoming traffic among multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### 2. Application Layer (Business Logic Tier)

- **AWS Services**: Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Lambda
- **Description**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes user requests, interacts with the database, and executes the core functions of the application. Depending on the complexity and requirements, it can be deployed on EC2 instances, managed container services like ECS, or serverless compute services like AWS Lambda. This repository contains code for deployment on EC2 Instances

### 3. Data Layer (Database Tier)

- **AWS Services**: Amazon RDS
- **Description**: The data layer is responsible for storing and retrieving application data. Relational databases like Amazon RDS can be used for structured data, while NoSQL databases like Amazon DynamoDB can be used for unstructured or semi-structured data. This code makes use of RDS

## Importance of Three-Tier Architecture

### Scalability

- Each layer can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient resource use and handling of varying loads. AWS provides auto-scaling capabilities to automatically adjust resources based on demand.

### Security

- Separating the application into tiers allows for more granular security controls. Security groups and network ACLs can be used to restrict access to resources, minimizing the attack surface.

### High Availability

- Deploying each tier across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in AWS ensures that the application remains available even if one AZ goes down. AWS services like ELB and RDS offer built-in features to support high availability.

### Flexibility

- Developers can update or modify each layer independently without affecting the others. This flexibility facilitates easier application updates and maintenance.

### Cost-Effectiveness

- Resources can be allocated and scaled based on the needs of each tier, optimizing costs. Pay-as-you-go pricing models of AWS services further contribute to cost efficiency.

## Conclusion

Deploying a three-tier web application on AWS leverages the cloud's scalability, reliability, and security features. By adopting this architecture, businesses can ensure their applications are robust, flexible, and ready to meet the demands of their users. Additionally, for an enhanced user experience, you can add Amazon Route 53 to provide a easy to read URL for connecting to the web application.
